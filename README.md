Hello. My name is Andy.

This is a project to demostrate my testing automation skills that I have learnt.

My scripts are to automate UI testing on website https://flask.io/bClNDCUhkKoX, which is a online todo list.

This project applies the following technologies:

Cucumber for BDD test cases
Python + Selenium for test steps
Behave for bridging the test cases and python scripts
Now there are mainly 2 files involved:

flask_todo_automation/features/flask.feature is the feature file that shows my test cases work on a todo web applcation
flask_todo_automation/features/steps/flask_steps.py is the python selenium script to run the logic
If you have any comments on my work, please contact me by email career@andymak.net
